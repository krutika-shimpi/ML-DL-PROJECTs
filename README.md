# Projects in Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Welcome to the ***ML-DL-PROJECTs*** repository, a collection of projects focused on Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

These projects were developed as part of the Edureka's DSML internship, encompassing various techniques in data cleaning, preprocessing, visualization, modeling, and evaluation commonly employed in the fields of Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

Let's delve into what each project entails:

## Mini Project 1: Stock Data Analysis using Python
**Skills Covered:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statistical Analysis, Data Analysis.

* **Business Scenario:** Data Science plays a crucial role in extracting meaningful insights from raw data, guiding decision-making across diverse business sectors. Finance, in particular, has embraced analytics to gain insights into market trends. In this project, we analyze data from the stock market, focusing on technology stocks such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.

* **Objective:** Utilize Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to extract, analyze, and visualize stock market data. Explore different approaches to assess the risk associated with a stock based on its performance history.

## Mini Project 2: Consumer Complaint Resolution Analysis Using Python
**Skills Covered:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Preprocessing, Data Visualization, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Machine Learning Modeling, Model Evaluation, Classification.

* **Scenario:** Product reviews are integral to understanding customer sentiments and addressing their concerns, ultimately driving sales growth. By analyzing consumer complaints, businesses can gain insights into customer satisfaction levels. In this project, we analyze consumer complaint data and employ various algorithms to classify customer categories, aiding in predicting outcomes for test data.

* **Objective:** Employ Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to perform data operations, visualization, and model building. Predict whether a customer dispute exists based on provided data.

## Mini Project 3 â€“ Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using NLP and Python
**Skills Covered:** Textual Data Analysis, Pandas, NumPy, Keras, TensorFlow, Text Preprocessing, Text Vectorization, Deep Learning Modeling, Training, Model Evaluation.

* **Scenario:** Textual data analysis, facilitated by Natural Language Processing (NLP), offers insights into non-numeric data, aiding decision-making across various domains. Twitter serves as a vast source of textual data, enabling sentiment analysis and product performance evaluation through user tweets and comments. In this project, we leverage NLP techniques to analyze sentiments expressed in tweets.

* **Objective:** Leverage Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and NLTK to perform data operations, visualization, and sentiment analysis. Predict different categories of sentiment expressed by Twitter users.
